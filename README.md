Report any bugs you encounter via github issues at this repository (not modmail or logviewer, as this is a community project).  
Use GitHub discussions for feature requests or to ask questions. Please prefer not to directly DM me, as it's not discoverable for other people that may help, and it's possible that I won't not notice it for a while.

### [Modmail-viewer & logviewer comparison](https://github.com/khakers/modmail-viewer/wiki/modmail-viewer-vs-logviewer)

## Self-hosting

You should place your _modmail-viewer_ instance behind Cloudflare or some other reverse proxy (such as Caddy) to provide
automatic https OR provide the required keys/certs to the application yourself if you plan on using authentication.

### Docker

Running the application with Docker is the fastest and best supported way to run _modmail-viewer_. Additionally, you
can easily run it using any service that supports running docker containers.

#### Docker Run

To quickly test _modmail-viewer_, you can use this docker run command. Make sure to substitute the environment variables
for what is applicable to you.

```shell
docker run --name modmail-viewer -p 80:80 \
  --env "MODMAIL_VIEWER_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017" \
  --env "MODMAIL_VIEWER_URL=http://127.0.0.1" \
  --env "MODMAIL_VIEWER_DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=1234" \
  --env "MODMAIL_VIEWER_DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=abcd" \
  -d ghcr.io/khakers/modmail-viewer:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

For long term ease of use, it's highly recommended that you use docker compose.
An example docker compose for running only _modmail-logviewer_.
> **Note**
> See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for a compose file that can run modmail, modmail-viewer, and mongodb.

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  viewer:
    image: ghcr.io/khakers/modmail-viewer:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      # uncomment if using SSL
      #- "443:443"
    environment:
      - "MODMAIL_VIEWER_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017"
      - "MODMAIL_VIEWER_URL=http://127.0.0.1"
```

##### .env example

Should be located next to your docker-compose.yml, contains secrets.

> **Note**
> See [the wiki page on authentication setup](https://github.com/khakers/modmail-viewer/wiki/Authentication-setup) for more information.

```properties
MODMAIL_VIEWER_DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=123456789
MODMAIL_VIEWER_DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=67234rtg3b2otgfhbn3298t7h
MODMAIL_VIEWER_SECRETKEY=secret
```

### Other

Before getting started, you'll need:

* A JDK/JRE 17 installation

Download the latest release from GitHub and unzip/tar the modmail-viewer archive

Run the webserver via the included scripts `bin/modmail-viewer` on linux, and `bin/modmail-viewer.bat` on windows.

It's recommended to either set up a reverse proxy (such as Cloudflare or Caddy) in front of your _modmail-logviewer_
instance, or enable SSL and provide your own certificate and private key. You can generate one for your domain
automatically with Certbot.

To run the webserver in the background, it's recommended you use a service manager such as Systemd.

| MODMAIL_VIEWER_ANALYTICS_BASE64            | Same as the above, but expects it's value to be base64 encoded.

| MODMAIL_VIEWER_BOT_ID                      | The id of your modmail discord bot. You likely don't *need* to specify this.
